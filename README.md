# What's Destack?

It's a tool to build landing pages within your [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project. It's powered by [Grapes.js](https://grapesjs.com/) and includes the complete set of blocks from [Tailblocks.cc](https://tailblocks.cc/). Supports asset uploading, form submission and a variaty of Tailwind colors. 

*Destack is a tool to help you stop worrying about the marketing pages and focus on your project.*

# Features

#### 🧱 Powerful Blocks

There are 92 well designed and heavily functional blocks from the [Tailblocks](https://tailblocks.cc/) project. Supports Tailwind's theme colors ie. Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Purple & Pink.

#### 🃏 Delightful Builder

Powered by [Grapes.js](https://grapesjs.com/), a flexible and feature-full editor similar to Webflow that supports margins, paddings, borders and a lot of others CSS-like options that are familiar to developers.

#### 🕹 Data Ownership

Destack stores all your assets on Github, Bitbucket etc through the editor. There are no external dependencies to manage or worry about.

#### 🏞 Assets & Forms Support

Stores the images uploaded in the editor in your repository & displays them when needed on production. Also supports HTML and API form submission out of the box.

#### 👩🏻‍💻 Easy Setup & Deployment

Works existing & new [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) projects. Requires minimal setup and no extra configuration to deploy your landing pages to production.

# Getting Started

### With a 

- Fork the [destack-starter](https://github.com/LiveDuo/destack-starter) project

- OR deploy a project to Vercel: [<img src="https://github.com/LiveDuo/destack/raw/main/assets/vercel_big.png" width="92">](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/LiveDuo/destack-starter&project-name=destack-starter&repository-name=destack-starter)

- OR preview it online with Gitpod: [<img src="https://github.com/LiveDuo/destack/raw/main/assets/gitpod_big.png" width="92">](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/LiveDuo/destack-starter)

### With an existing project:

##### 1. Install Destack on your Next.js project

```sh
npm i destack
```

##### 2. Setup the builder endpoint

Create `pages/api/builder/handle.js` and add the following:
```js
export { handleData as default, config } from 'destack/build/server'
```

##### 3. Then create a new page

On any Next.js page you want to setup Destack:
```js
import 'grapesjs/dist/css/grapes.min.css'
export { getStaticProps } from 'destack/build/server'
export { ContentProvider as default } from 'destack'
```

```js
import { ContentProvider } from 'destack'
import 'grapesjs/dist/css/grapes.min.css'

export { getStaticProps } from 'destack/build/server'

export default function Page(props) { 
    return (
        <div style={{height: '100%'}}>
            <span>Hello world</span>
            <ContentProvider {...props}/>
        </div>)
}
```
</details>

# How it works

🛠 Destack is composed of two main components, the first is a React component that shows the editor or the generated page and the second is a Next.js API route that saves your progress to your repository.

👨‍💻 When you run the project in `development` (ie. with `npm run dev`) the React component understands it from the `NODE_ENV` environment variable and shows you the editor where you can create your landing page visually. 

💡 Every change you make goes to the API route which updates a `default.json` file. That file contains the HTML for your landing page and it remembers how you structure your page so you can come back later to update it. 

🚀 When is time to go in `production` (ie. do `npm run build`  or deploy to Vercel) the React component reads `NODE_ENV` again and statically generates the HTML version of the page you build in the editor from the `default.json` file Destack created for you earlier.

# How to's & guides

### Adding an HTML form

- Drop a block that contains a form
- Click on the form & head to components settings
- Add form URL & check `async` if don't want a redirection
- To handle a `async` forms you can create an API route (eg. [api/submit.js](https://github.com/LiveDuo/destack/blob/main/dev/nextjs-project/pages/api/submit.js))

### Uploading images

- Drop a block that contains an image or use image block
- Click on an image to open the upload modal
- Select the image you want to update and click on it to add it to the page
- Notes: Images are uploaded to `public/uploaded` with their original filenames

### Show editor in production

- Install Destack to a new or existing project
- Set `showEditorInProd={true}` in the `ContentProvider` component
- The result should be similar to [Destack Online Builder](https://destack-page.vercel.app/)

# How is this possible?

This project was none's bright idea. It was not something that was planned and design in depth in advance. Instead it was evolved out of the need and enjoyment of using some amazing tools and prototype quickly. These projects heavily improved my developer life and a few of my friends'.

> Next.js 🅧 ➕ Tailwind CSS 🍃 ➕ Grapes.js 🍇 = 💣💣

Please go and show these projects some love (⭐️). Don't forget to check out [Tailblocks.cc](https://tailblocks.cc/), without Mert's amazing designs none of this would have been possible.
